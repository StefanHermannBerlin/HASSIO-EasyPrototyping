In this image you can see a breadboard build up with all supported components.

- D0: Output LED1 showing if Digital Input 1 is high or low (internal LED1 on NodeMCU is working as well)
- D1: Digital Input 1
- D2: Digital Input 2
- D3: Digital Output to WS2812 addressable RGB-LED
- D4: Output LED2 showing if Digital Input 2 is high or low (internal LED1 on NodeMCU is working as well) 
- D5: Analog Output 1
- D6: Analog Output 2
- D7: Input from DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor
- D8: Output to Servo or Speaker (not implemented in code yet)
